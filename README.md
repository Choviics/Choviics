  ## About me
<p>
Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Vicente Córdova, and I am currently in my final year at Andrés Bello University👨‍🎓. I am from Chile and I am 23 years old. Throughout my academic career, I have developed projects in machine learning🤖 and data analysis📊, and I have gained experience in backend web development. Additionally, I am very proud to have completed a project aimed at helping students at Andrés Bello University learn about data structures in code. This project allows them to understand what each line of code does and how it affects the data, providing them with valuable tools for their professional future.📝💡

I have also developed an application that translates TSV files from a game🎮 using the DeepL API, and I have published a Spanish version of the game on <a href="https://github.com/Ublyudok-kun/DAL_FANSUB">GitHub</a> along with an installer for these translated files.
